    "### Exercise 1: Is it hot or cold outside? [30 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first exercise for today is to once again solve the problem we looked at during the lab class (with very minor modifications). The problem setup is as follows: Let's suppose that we have a smart home with a temperature sensor in it, such that we want to predict whether it's hot or cold outside. Our temperature sensor measures the temperature unreliably: if the temperature is high, the sensor will report that it is high in $95\\%$ of the cases; similarly, if the temperature is low, the sensor will report a high temperature in $10\\%$ of the cases. Based on some old statistics, we know that if the temperature is high on day $t$, it will be high on day $t+1$ in $70\\%$ of the cases; similarly, if the temperature is low on day $t$, there is a $20\\%$ chance that it will be high on day $t+1$.\n",
